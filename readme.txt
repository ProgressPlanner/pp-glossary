A semantic, accessible WordPress glossary plugin that automatically links terms to click-triggered popover definitions.

== Description ==

Glossary by Progress Planner is a modern, accessible WordPress glossary plugin that automatically transforms glossary terms in your content into interactive elements with click-triggered popover definitions.

= Key Features =

* **Custom Post Type**: Register glossary entries with custom fields (no content editor needed)
* **Native WordPress Fields**: Uses WordPress custom meta boxes for field management (short description, long description, synonyms)
* **Automatic Term Linking**: Automatically transforms the first mention of glossary terms in your content
* **Click-Triggered Popovers**: Display definitions on click using the native Popover API with CSS Anchor Positioning
* **Case Sensitive Matching**: Optionally match terms only when case matches exactly
* **Disable Auto-Linking**: Allow entries to appear in the glossary without being automatically linked in content
* **Semantic HTML**: Uses `<dfn>` and `<aside>` elements with proper ARIA attributes
* **Schema.org Integration**: Full DefinedTerm and DefinedTermSet structured data support
  * Integrates with Yoast SEO schema graph when available
  * Falls back to Microdata when Yoast SEO is not active
* **Synonyms Support**: Define alternative terms that trigger the same glossary entry
* **Glossary Block**: Gutenberg block to display full glossary with alphabetical navigation
* **Settings Page**: Configure which page displays the glossary
* **Accessible**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
* **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly with CSS custom properties for easy theming
* **No External Dependencies**: Pure WordPress core functionality, no third-party plugins required

= How It Works =

Once you've added glossary entries, the plugin automatically:

* Scans post and page content for mentions of glossary terms (case-insensitive by default, or case-sensitive if enabled)
* Transforms the **first mention** of each term into an interactive element (unless auto-linking is disabled for that entry)
* Shows a popover with the short description when users click on the term
* Adds a "Read more" link to the full glossary entry

= Browser Support =

The plugin uses modern web platform features:

**Popover API:**
* Chrome/Edge 114+
* Safari 17+
* Firefox (experimental support behind flag)

**CSS Anchor Positioning:**
* Chrome/Edge 125+/Safari: supported
* Firefox (not yet supported)

For older browsers, consider adding the Popover API polyfill. CSS Anchor Positioning gracefully degrades (popovers may not position optimally but will still be functional).

= Accessibility =

The plugin follows WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines:

* Semantic HTML elements (`<dfn>`, `<aside>`, proper roles)
* Full keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators
* ARIA attributes for screen readers
* Click-to-open behavior (not hover) for better accessibility
* Auto-dismissing popovers that don't overlap
* Color contrast ratios meet AA standards

= Schema.org Structured Data =

The plugin automatically adds Schema.org structured data for glossary entries:

* **With Yoast SEO**: Integrates with the Yoast schema graph API to add DefinedTermSet and DefinedTerm entries in JSON-LD format
* **Without Yoast SEO**: Outputs Microdata markup directly in the HTML using `itemscope` and `itemtype` attributes

Each glossary entry includes:
* @type: DefinedTerm
* name: The term title
* description: Short description (shown in popovers)
* url: Anchor link to the entry on the glossary page
* alternateName: Array of synonyms (alternative terms)

== Installation ==

= Automatic Installation =

1. Log in to your WordPress admin panel
2. Navigate to Plugins > Add New
3. Search for "Glossary by Progress Planner"
4. Click "Install Now" and then "Activate"

= Manual Installation =

1. Download the plugin zip file
2. Extract it to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

= Setup =

1. **Create a Glossary Page**: Create a new page in WordPress (e.g., "Glossary" or "Terms") and add the **Glossary List** block to the page
2. **Configure Settings**: Go to **Glossary > Settings** in the WordPress admin and select the page you created as the "Glossary Page"
3. **Add Glossary Entries**: Go to **Glossary > Add New** and enter terms with their short descriptions, long descriptions, and synonyms

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require any other plugins? =

No, this plugin uses only native WordPress functionality and has no external dependencies.

= Which browsers are supported? =

The plugin works best in modern browsers with Popover API support (Chrome 114+, Edge 114+, Safari 17+). For older browsers, consider adding the Popover API polyfill.

= Does it work with Yoast SEO? =

Yes! The plugin integrates seamlessly with Yoast SEO, adding glossary structured data to Yoast's JSON-LD schema graph. When Yoast SEO is not active, it falls back to Microdata markup.

= Can I customize the styling? =

Yes, the plugin uses CSS custom properties for easy theming. You can override the default colors and styles in your theme's CSS.

= How do I disable automatic linking for specific post types? =

Use the `pp_glossary_disabled_post_types` filter:

`add_filter( 'pp_glossary_disabled_post_types', function( $post_types ) {
    return array( 'product', 'custom_post_type' );
} );`

= Does it work with the block editor? =

Yes, the plugin includes a Glossary List block that you can add to any page or post using the block editor.

== Changelog ==

= 1.2 =

* Excluded glossary entries from Yoast SEO indexables and XML sitemaps (entries have no public pages).
* Excluded glossary entries from WordPress search results.
* Removed revision support (all data is in post meta, not tracked by revisions).
* Added a setting to configure excluded HTML tags where glossary terms should not be highlighted.
* Added a setting to exclude specific post types from glossary term highlighting.
* Do not highlight glossary terms when doing feeds or REST requests.

= 1.1.0 =

* Added case sensitive option for glossary entries - only matches terms when case matches exactly. ([GH issue #23](https://github.com/ProgressPlanner/pp-glossary/issues/23))
* Added disable auto-linking option - allows entries to appear in the glossary without being automatically linked in content. ([GH issue #19](https://github.com/ProgressPlanner/pp-glossary/issues/19))
* Consolidated glossary entry meta data into a single database post meta field for improved performance.
* Added automatic migration system for seamless upgrades.
* Glossary block improvements:
   * Now falls back to short description when long description is empty.
   * Now shows an edit link for logged in users per glossary item.
* Lots of accessibility fixes thanks to [@joedolson](https://github.com/joedolson):
  * Popover now opens on click, not on hover, and no longer auto-closes. ([GH issue #15](https://github.com/ProgressPlanner/pp-glossary/issues/15)) & ([#16](https://github.com/ProgressPlanner/pp-glossary/issues/16))
  * Removed redundant `aria-describedby` attribute. ([GH issue #16](https://github.com/ProgressPlanner/pp-glossary/issues/16))
  * Link appears inside the popover before the definition, to give context to people using screen readers better. ([GH issue #17](https://github.com/ProgressPlanner/pp-glossary/issues/17))
  * Popovers are now type `auto` instead of `manual` which means they dismiss other popovers so they don't overlap. ([GH issue #18](https://github.com/ProgressPlanner/pp-glossary/issues/18))
